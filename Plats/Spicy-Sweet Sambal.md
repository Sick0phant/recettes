## Ingrédients

* olive oil
* ~0.9kg ground pork, divided
* ~5cm piece of ginger
* 8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 2 Tbsp. sugar
* 2 Tbsp. tomato paste
* 2 sprigs basil, plus more for serving
* 40-50g hot chili paste (such as sambal oelek), can also use harissa
* ~50-70ml soy sauce
* ~50-70ml cup unseasoned rice vinegar
* ~500g pasta
* Kosher salt
* 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter

## Préparation

1. Heat oil in a large wide heavy pot over medium-high. Add half of pork to pot, breaking apart into 6–8 large chunks with a wooden spoon. Cook, undisturbed, until well browned underneath, about 5 minutes.
2. Turn pieces and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until pork is browned on 2–3 sides, about 5 minutes longer.
3. Add ginger, garlic, sugar, and remaining pork to pot and cook, breaking up pork into small clumps, until meat is nearly cooked through, about 5 minutes longer.
4. Add tomato paste and 2 basil sprigs. Cook, stirring occasionally, until paste darkens, about 2 minutes.
5. Add chili paste, soy sauce, vinegar, and 500ml water. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and flavors have melded, 30–45 minutes.
6. Top noodles with torn basil.
