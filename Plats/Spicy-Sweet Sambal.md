## Ingrédients

* 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 lb. ground pork, divided
* 1 2" piece fresh ginger, peeled, cut into thin matchsticks or finely chopped
* 8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 2 Tbsp. sugar
* 2 Tbsp. tomato paste
* 2 sprigs basil, plus more for serving
* 1/3 cup hot chili paste (such as sambal oelek), can also use harissa
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
* 1 + 1/2 lb. fresh ramen noodles or 16 oz. dried spaghetti
* Kosher salt
* 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter

## Préparation

1. Heat oil in a large wide heavy pot over medium-high. Add half of pork to pot, breaking apart into 6–8 large chunks with a wooden spoon. Cook, undisturbed, until well browned underneath, about 5 minutes.
2. Turn pieces and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until pork is browned on 2–3 sides, about 5 minutes longer.
3. Add ginger, garlic, sugar, and remaining pork to pot and cook, breaking up pork into small clumps, until meat is nearly cooked through, about 5 minutes longer.
4. Add tomato paste and 2 basil sprigs. Cook, stirring occasionally, until paste darkens, about 2 minutes.
5. Add chili paste, soy sauce, vinegar, and 2 cups water. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and flavors have melded, 30–45 minutes.
6. Top noodles with torn basil.
